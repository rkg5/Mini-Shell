# Mini-Shell
Mini Shell is a C++ program that emulates a Linux shell, supporting piped commands, background execution, and signal handling. It uses the readline library for cursor movement and maintains command history with STL data structures. 
The shell also includes file-lock detection and a heuristic command for identifying malware.
